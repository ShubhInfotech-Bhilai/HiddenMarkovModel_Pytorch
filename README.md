# Hidden Markov Model in Pytorch

This is a practical project for the learning of PGM, which is based on the [tensorflow implementation](https://github.com/MarvinBertin/HiddenMarkovModel_TensorFlow) from [Marvin Bertin](https://github.com/MarvinBertin).

Viterbi, Forward-Backward and Baum Welch are implemented.
